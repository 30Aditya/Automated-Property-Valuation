# Automated-Property-Valuation
This project uses K-Means clustering to group houses based on area, bedrooms, and age. It applies scaling, identifies the optimal cluster count using the Elbow method, and visualizes results with 2D and 3D plots. The model also predicts the price range of a new house based on its assigned cluster.
